# VirtualMachineDSA
  I can say that it is difficult for if you dont understand clearly about VIRTUAL MACHINE working mechanism.
  Read again and again if you dont understand.
  This code is not perfect and it have some errors about exceptions but it is made in the level of student.
  Assignment_1: I think this part is difficult in this project because it describes get input mechanism and how to handle them.
  Assignment_2: You need to work with AVL tree and how a cache works, we have some policies for you like FIFO,LIFO,LRU,MSU,LFU,RR
  Assignment_3: You need to work with hash search and implement them to FIFO,MSU,LFU,LRU.
